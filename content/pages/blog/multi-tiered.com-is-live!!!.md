### **Multi-Tiered.com is LIVE!!!**

We're excited to announce that [**Multi-Tiered.com**](Multi-Tiered.com) is officially live! This site will be the home for all our projects and developments, and we’re thrilled to finally share it with you.

#### New Host, New Design

We’ve recently transitioned to using **Netlify** and **GitHub Pages** to host the website. The current design is simple and minimal, but we’re laying the groundwork for exciting new features in the future. The goal is to enhance both functionality and user experience, so stay tuned for updates.

While the site may be basic right now, we’re working hard behind the scenes to roll out new features and projects. In the near future, you’ll be able to explore:

*   **Privated** [**Project 1**](https://multi-tiered.com/projects/project-two/) *- currently in closed testing and private testing, Alpha testing Post coming soon*

*   **Privated** [**Project 2**](https://multi-tiered.com/projects/project-three/) - *currently in development* \*\*\*\*

We’ll keep you posted as these projects take shape, so make sure to bookmark the site and check back regularly.

#### **More Features**

Along with the host change and backend, we also have a better blog system with more features for posts/articles and cleaner **Projects pages the website is featured** [***Multi-Tiered Website.***](https://multi-tiered.com/projects/project-one/) We will have a website, Project 1 and Project 2 project pages updated regularly so make sure to check regularly.

#### **What's next?**

Working on Project 1 is very important currently so all focus is on that once there is more information we will have posts on [X](https://x.com/multi_tiered) and also videos on [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Multi-Tiered) so follow
